The Odin Project's Library Assignment

General Thoughts: This was a mini-project that was supposed to test our knowledge in arrays, contsructors, and prototypes. Before this assignment, I did not have much experience with arrays, which made the project a lot more challenging. Specifically, I was stuck on figuring out how to delete certain books from the array. To solve this issue, I made it so that every book is assigned a class of unique ID. Then, I created the function `remBook()` which would find the index of the book based on its unique ID, and remove it from the array using splice.

The assignment also mentions that I'll have the opportunity to refactor the code in future lessons, so I purposely left out the CSS portion for now. I have an idea of how I want to design the project once I learn more about React.

What I learned:

- how to find indices using unique ID
- how to push new objects into array using form inputs
- how to utilize a constructor
